# SaturdayHackNight_DiscordAPI
This repo consists of the project built during the Saturday hack night event of Tinkerhub
Built a discord bot for computing calculations of advanced mathematics.
This bot can perfrom various mathematical functions and implementation in discord as follows:
!simplify expression => simplify expression
!factor expression => factors nth degree polynomial
!derive expression => calculates derivative of a function
!integrate expression => integrates function
!zeroes expression => find the roots of a function
!areaundercurve expression =>finds area under the curve of the expression
!cos angle=> finds the cosine of the angle
!sin angle=> finds the sine of the angle
!tan angle=> finds the tan of the angle
!inversecosine value=> finds the cosine inverse of the value
!inversesine value=> finds the sine inverse of the value
!inversetan value=> finds the inverse of the tangent of the value
!absolute value=> finds the absolute value of an expression
!log value=> finds the logarithmic value
