# SaturdayHackNight_DiscordAPI
This repo consists of the project built during the Saturday hack night event of Tinkerhub
Built a discord bot for computing calculations of advanced mathematics.
This bot can perfrom various mathematical functions and implementation in discord as follows:

!simplify expression => simplify expression

!factor expression => factors nth degree polynomial

!derive expression => calculates derivative of a function

!integrate expression => integrates function

!zeroes expression => find the roots of a function

!areaundercurve expression =>finds area under the curve of the expression

!cos angle=> finds the cosine of the angle

!sin angle=> finds the sine of the angle

!tan angle=> finds the tan of the angle

!inversecosine value=> finds the cosine inverse of the value

!inversesine value=> finds the sine inverse of the value

!inversetan value=> finds the inverse of the tangent of the value

!absolute value=> finds the absolute value of an expression

!log value=> finds the logarithmic value
